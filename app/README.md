This is very much a work in progress and meant as a portfolio piece.

Currently this is a very basic app, it does not follow any mathematical rules (eg. BODMAS) and many buttons are yet to be implemented.

I plan to continuously update this project, adding more functionality until completed in order to show my work progress from the very start of building an app.

Any comments or criticism to steepen my learning curve is always appreciated.

Version 0.1
  - Basic Left to Right computation of integer numbers
  - Buttons implemented
    - Numerical buttons (0-9)
    - Add (+), subtract (-) , divide (รท), multiply (ร) and equals (=)
    - All Clear (AC)

Version 0.2
  - Decimal calculations with BigDecimal values
  - New class Equate to handle calculations
  - Simple JUnit Testing
  - Buttons implemented
    - Decimal (.) button

Thank you for reading
