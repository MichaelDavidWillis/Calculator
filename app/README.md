This is very much a work in progress and meant as a portfolio piece.

Currently this is a very basic app, it does not follow any mathematical rules (eg. BODMAS) and many buttons are yet to be implemented. At this point I have spent a day building the app and an evening documenting the files and publishing on GitHub.

I plan to continuously update this project, adding more functionality until completed in order to show my work progress from the very start of building an app.

Any comments or criticism to steepen my learning curve is always appreciated.

Thank you for reading
